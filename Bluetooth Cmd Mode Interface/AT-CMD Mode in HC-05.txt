Steps to activate command mode in HC-05 Bluetooth module using Arduino UNO:

  1. First open Arduino IDE and then upload the blank sketch in your Arduino board.
  2. Then make connection to the Bluetooth module accordingly like this:

    Bluetooth -- arduino
    
    vcc -- 5v
    gnd -- 0v
    tx  -- tx
    rx  -- rx

    use potential divider network to level shift 5v to 3.3v

  3. Now connect usb to power the arduino board and then first press the on-board button on the bluetooth module and then connect
     the vcc of bluetooth module to 5v holding the on-board button to enter the AT cmd mode.

  4. Now you will see the status led of the bluetooth module blinking slowly with blinking speed of (one blink/2 sec).
     this way you will enter cmd mode in bluetooth module.

  5. Now use all the cmd given in the pdf to execute different codes.


    So simple to use........
